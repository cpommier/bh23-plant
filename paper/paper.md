# Background

The field of plant research is characterized by vast amounts of data generated from diverse sources and studies, resulting in significant data dispersion and heterogeneity. Researchers often face challenges in accessing, integrating, and analyzing these disparate datasets due to their low findability and to differences in formats, structures, and standards. There are several solutions to this problem that cope with different parts of the FAIR principles. The plant community has decided in particular to solve the interoperability and the findability problem by building common data standards such as the Minimum Information About Plant Phenotyping Experiments (MIAPPE^1^, www.miappe.org) and the Breeding API (BrAPI^2^, www.brapi.org) as well as a data portal, FAIR Data-finder for Agronomic Research (FAIDARE). The building in those solutions has been initiated around 2015 with a global perspective in mind in the frame of european infrastructures (ELIXIR^3^, EMPHASIS) and international networks(Bioversity of the CGIAR, NAPPN). The BioHackathon Japan 2023, was an ideal event to outreach those solutions toward the Japanese researchers and bioinformaticians in order to increase visibility of Japanese databases in the plant research data discovery portal FAIDARE and explore the use of the Breeding API for knowledge graph. 

The FAIDARE data portal has been initiated in 2015 in the frame of the ELIXIR European research infrastructure and the wheatIS of the wheat initiative (https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/ , http://www.wheatis.org/Search.php). It indexes 30 databases across the globe, including genomic, genetic and phenomic data. It provides search capabilities using full text approaches based on Elasticsearch, as well as ontology driven filters tailored for the need of plant researchers.  One of the keys to its success is its community management that eases the indexation of new databases (https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/join). Indeed, this indexation relies on (i) a minimal approach (Data discovery files) that allows to index any datatype or (ii) a more detailed one, based on the Breeding API specifications for genetic material (germplasm) and phenotyping or genotyping studies. 

The MIAPPE data standard is intialy designed to describe and formalize plant phenomics studies. But some of its elements are important shared key resources, or interoperability pivot. It is in particular the case of the plant genetic resources, or biological material. As a consequence, the Biological section of MIAPPE has been embeded in a dedicated [checklist](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/schemas/certification/plant-miappe.json), used during EBI Biosample submission. Its usage has been documented in the Research Data Management Toolkit RDMKit and the FAIRCookBook. The [RDMKit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) is a portal to best practices and guidelines that help researchers, data steward, producer and scientist to make their data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). It contains a community maintained [plant page](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/plant_sciences) that should be used as an entry point for plant data management. Furthermore, it links to a [Phenomic tools assembly](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/plant_phenomics_assembly) and to a [Genomic tool assembly](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/plant_genomics_assembly) which describe in details the submission workflow of genomic and variation data at EBI ENA and EVA.

We also identified an interesting opportunity around pedigrees and graph databases. Indeed several data resources around the globe propose pedigree informations such as Pedigree Finder^4^[@Kajiya-Kanegae2022], [UK wheat varieties pedigree](https://www.niab.com/uk-wheat-varieties-pedigree), FAIDARE, [CTPS](https://www.geves.fr/about-us/the-ctps/) or [Eurisco](https://eurisco.ipk-gatersleben.de/apex/eurisco_ws/r/eurisco/home) in format such as the [Helium data format](https://github.com/cardinalb/helium-docs/wiki/Download-Helium) or BrAPI. 



# Outcomes

The main goal is to integrate germoplasm and genomic data in Japan at FAIDARE. Therefore, a mapping has been performed between BioSample database at DDBJ with MIAPPE specifications based on RDMkit and FAIRCookBook. Mostly the attributes exist in both systems, with a different terms (Table) and we are proposing to create a consensus MixS Plant extended accordingly with the Genomic Standards Consortioum ([GSC](http://www.gensc.org/pages/standards/checklists.html)) [checklists](http://www.gensc.org/pages/standards/checklists.html). We are proposing to create new fields at the [DDBJ BioSample package](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/biosample) in order to follow MIAPPE such as, biological material (latitute, longitude, altitude, coordinates uncertainty and preprocessing) and material source (ID, DOI, description, latitute, longitude, altitude, coordinates uncertainty). Some changes at DDBJ BioSample package were suggested, the feature organism be split into genus and species, and unify strain, isolate, breed and cultivar as infraspecific name. Note that Biosample DDBJ packages are equivalent to EBI Checklists. 

We started the integration using a rice cultivar sample extracted from the Rice Core Collection of Japanese Landraces [NARO Genebank](https://www.gene.affrc.go.jp/databases-core_collections_jr_en.php), and BioSample ids from DDBJ using taxon id and cultivar name. From DDBJ information such as experiments, study name, cultivar name and DDBJ URI were integrated with germoplasm id and URI, from NARO. This NARO rice dataset was selected to test the indexation of DDBJ biosample and experiment in the FAIDARE data portal. Two files were generated in json format, germplasm and study. The former contains germplasm id, which were associate with BioSample id from DDBJ, experiment, germplasm name, taxon id from NCBI taxon, genus, species and variety names, germplasm URI (which links to the correspondent DDBJ BioSample), holding institute name responsible for submitting the genomic data to DDBJ, project id and external reference which links to the NARO Genbank URI. The later has experiment id from DDBJ with study name, study description, last update, submitter name and URI refering DDBJ experiment.

Those data were then tested in a local instance of FAIDARE, alongside INRAE data. This allowed to succesfully doing full text search in all the fields and to filter by species, database, datatype. Following this demonstration, the data will be loaded in the beta instance of FAIDARE. It will then be possible to extract the whole plant dataset from DDBJ and insert those metadata into the production instance of FAIDARE.



We also initated the work on knowledge graph building by reviewing some the potential datasets previously identified, including aditional datasources to provide linked IDs between DDBJ Biosample, NARO, [Plant GARDEN](https://plantgarden.jp/en/index) at Kazusa DNA Research Institute. Nonetheless, a more exhaustive review of the data and linked ID resources is necessary before carrying on that work.

# Future work
We will finalize the DDBJ databases indexation in FAIDARE public instance after validation by DDBJ teams.
We plan to improve the Biosample Checklist for at least EBI and DDBJ, by elaborating on ENA MixS and MIAPPE, used at EBI Biosample/EVA, in this direction, a workgroup was already created between ELIXIR and DDBJ. We plan to improve the attributes (terms) to enrich the indexation in DDBJ@FAIDARE and make regular releases. 
We also plan to explore pedigree knowledge graph based on Japanese and European data source, as well as, identify and prepare datasets for an upcoming biohackathon.
